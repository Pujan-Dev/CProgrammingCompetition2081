## **Project Description** ##

Eastern-CinePlex is a group Project developed for the submission of the final project for C-Programming as I/I (first-year first part) students of electronics engineering at IOE Purwanchal Campus, Dharan. The project reflects a movie ticket management system that allows admin and user login functionality.

**Eastern-CinePlex** is a non-gui project that runs on a terminal and reflects just the internal logic behind how a ticket management system might function in the real world. The primary highlight of the project is a well-thought interface for the terminal.

The project allows users to register with their username, password, and phone number while an admin is hard-coded into the application. The user can view the current movies in the listing, select the movie to view available shows and seats and book the ticket. The admin can change the ticket price, add a film to the listing, create shows, and view already booked shows and earned balance.

## How to run the project??
- Download all the files in one folder it must include `extra.h`, `main.c`, `users.txt`, `user.c`, `login.c`, `admin.c` file.
- Run `gcc main.c -o main` or Build `main.c` file.
- Run `./main` or execute `main.c` file.
- `Admin-interface` access is hardcoded and for its access:
    - Username: `Abhishek`
    - Password: `pass`

## Additional Info:
The project is a infinitely run system and it offers optimum facility if run infinitely. You can exit the coding system by `CTRL+C` but we recomend to use the available options in the interface that we created to run the program. If by any chance the system is exited in the middle of execution all the data changed will be flushed.
