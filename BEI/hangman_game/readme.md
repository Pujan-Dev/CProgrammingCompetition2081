## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in C. The player has to guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. For every incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game ends either when the player guesses the word correctly or when the hangman is complete.

## How to Run
To run the Hangman game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.
3. Compile the C program using a C compiler. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) by running the following command:
    ```
    gcc hangman.c -o hangman
    ```
4. Once compiled successfully, run the executable file. For example:
    ```
    ./hangman
    ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Note
- The game's word list is pre-defined in the code for simplicity. You can modify the `words` array in the code to include your own set of words.
- Ensure that you have a C compiler installed on your system to compile the code.
